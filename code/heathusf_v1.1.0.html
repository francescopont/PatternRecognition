<B>Preface</B>
<P>
The purpose of this web page is to describe some software for computer aided detection
of cancer in mammograms that I have developed at the University of South Florida.
I am posting this software on the world wide web to encourage and simplify the
quantitative performance of computer aided detection algorithms. The programs
included in this software were developed using mammography data in the
<A HREF="../Database.html">Digital Database for
Screening Mammography</A> (DDSM) at the <A HREF="http://www.usf.edu">University of South
Florida</A>. This software provides many tools for manipulating and displaying images from
the DDSM database as well as providing a mass detection algorithm and CAD performance
evaluation tools.
</P>

<B>Feedback</B>
<P>
If you use this software and have any constructive comments on it, please send them to
me (<A HREF="MAILTO:heath@csee.usf.edu">heath@csee.usf.edu</A>). Even if you are just
simply trying out the software, I would appreciate a short note from you. This
feedback will let me know if the time I spent releaseing this software was well spent and
will give me an indication as to whether I should invest more time on this work in the
future.
</P>

<B>Simply Using the Software</B>

<P>
This section describes some steps you can follow to use the mass detection
software. I will assume that your hardware and software are the same as mine
(I am using a Sun workstation running SunOS 5.6). If you are running another
version of SunOS, Linux or some other version of UNIX, you should be able to
get this code working on your system without too much effort. I made this software
run on my PC at home (Pentium 233, 64MB of RAM) running Caldera OpenLinux after
small investment of time (Hint: see code/compression/JPEG/PVRG/jpegdir/IMPORTANT_NOTE_BY_MIKE_HEATH and
set the parameter to swap the bytes in functions that read DDSM images).
</P>

<P>
I am assuming that your home directory is ~yourhome and that you down load
the software <A HREF="ftp://marathon.csee.usf.edu/pub/heathusf/heathusf_v1.1.0.tar.gz">heathusf_v1.1.0.tar.gz</A>
(this replaces the older version
<A HREF="ftp://marathon.csee.usf.edu/pub/heathusf/heathusf_v1.0.0.tar.gz">heathusf_v1.0.0.tar.gz</A>) into
a directory named ~yourhome/heathusf. Uncompress and untar the software and compile
the programs by using the following commands:
<CENTER><PRE><B>cd ~yourhome/heathusf</B></PRE></CENTER>
<CENTER><PRE><B>gunzip -c heathusf_v1.0.0.tar.gz | tar -xvf -</B></PRE></CENTER>
<CENTER><PRE><B>cd code</B></PRE></CENTER>
<CENTER><PRE><B>build_heathusf</B></PRE></CENTER>
</P>

<P>
You will need to down load some cases of data from the DDSM to have some data to process.
I will assume that the data is on your system in the directory /tmp/yourhome. In
that directory you will need to have cases of data in subdirectories named case####
(i.e. <A HREF="ftp://figment.csee.usf.edu/pub/DDSM/cases/cancers/cancer_10/case1622">case1622</A>).
From within the directory /tmp/yourhome type:
<CENTER><PRE><B>~yourhome/heathusf/code/scripts/detect_and_FROC_mass</B></PRE></CENTER>
This will run the mass detection algorithm on each case and create a file named
performance.txt. That file will have the true positive fraction and the average
number of false positives per image as the last two columns of data in the file.
This takes around 20 minutes per case of data on my system (Sun Ultra30) so be prepared
to wait a while if you are running on multiple cases of data or if your computer
is not as fast as mine.
</P>

<B>Software Organization</B>

<P>
This section is for those of you who want to know a little more about the software,
how it is organized and what tools are there for you to use.
</P>

<P>
All of the software was written in 'C' and was developed on a Sun workstation
running SunOS 5.6 using the compiler gcc. The software is organized into a
common directory where a library of functions is built and into
several application directories. Scripts (tcsh) are used to handle the flow
of processing because this allows the automated processing of large sets of
cases with one command.
</P>

<P>
Below is a table describing some of the scripts I have written. The puspose of
these scripts is to automate the entire mass detection and evalutation
process to allow others to duplicate the results I obtained with this algorithm and
to provide example scripts so others can learn how to write their own scripts
that use the programs in this package.
</P>

<TABLE BORDER=2>
<TR><TH>Macro Level Script</TH><TH>Description</TH></TR>

<TR>
<TD>runAFUMcase</TD>
<TD> This script will run a mass detection program on a case from the DDSM database.
A file will be created for each mammogram containing a list of potential detection
sites in the image with detections listed in decreasing order of suspicion. The
script should be run from a directory where the case to process is in an immediate
subdirectory named case####. In processing the case, images are decompressed, the
breast boundary is segmented, a feature image is produced, the detection files are
created and the decompressed images are deleted.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>create_FROC_mass</TD>
<TD> This script will run the performance evaluation program (DDSMeval) on each
case of from the DDSM (that is in a current subdirectory) and will output the data
you can plot to form an FROC curve. The script will use all of the detection
files in each directory. These could be files produced by your own CAD algorithm
or they could be files produced by the script runAFUMcase. To compare results
from your CAD algorithm with mine you must run the scripts as they are currently
configured and must not use the test data in any way until you are actually
evaluating the performance of your algorithm (You can do this only once. Otherwise
it is not fair to compare the performance of your algorithm to mine because
you have used the test data as training data.).</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>detect_and_FROC_mass</TD>
<TD> This script automates the entire detection and performance evaluation. Just
place yourself in a directory with a set of cases in its subdirectories and then
run this script. It may take hours or days to run a large set of cases on your
computer. This script calls both the runAFUMcase and create_FROC_mass scripts.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>make_reduced_images</TD>
<TD> This script will make 8 bit images of all the DDSM images in cases that
are in subdirectories of the directory where the script is run. The script is
configured to output 8bit PGM files scaled with optical densities in the
range 3.0 to 0.05. The images will be created at any resolution you specify that
is greater than or equal to the original resolution of the DDSM images. One could
easily reconfigure the script to make images at other resolutions, in 16bits, in
TIFF format or with other rescalings of pixel values.</TD>
</TR>

</TABLE>

<br>

<P>
Below is a table that provides a list of the programs that are in this package.
Next to each is a short description of what each program does. Once you have
downloaded the package and compiled it on your system, you can run any program
with no arguments and get information on how to run that program.
</P>

<TABLE BORDER=2>
<TR><TH>Program</TH><TH>Description</TH></TR>

<TR>
<TD>jpeg</TD>
<TD>This program can decompress a lossless compressed mammogram in the DDSM database.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>breastsegment</TD>
<TD>This program will segment the breast from an image and produce an ASCII
file of the polygon outlining the breast region.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>afumfeature</TD>
<TD>This program will produce a probability of suspiciousness image using a novel
Average Fraction (of pixels) Under the Minimum filter.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>detect</TD>
<TD>This program will produce a detection file listing a set of possible detection sites
in decreasing order of suspicion. Any program that will use this file must make the decision
regarding which subset of detections to use from the file. Two possible methods of selecting
a subset are to take at most some maximum number of detections (starting with the first one)
or to take all detections with a suspiciousness value higher than some threshold suspiciousness value.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>mkimage</TD>
<TD>This program will produce a PGM or TIFF image in 8 or 16 bits at any given
resolution from a decompressed LJPEG.1 image from the DDSM database. Options
are provided for rescaling the image in gray values or in optical density values.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>mktemplate</TD>
<TD>This program will create a binary or labeled image from a DDSM ground truth
file (.OVERLAY) at any specified resolution. Many options allow the user to
specify the desired lesion type and descriptive properties as well as the pathology
of the lesions that are rendered in the template image. The image can be saved in
either PGM or TIFF format.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>drawimage</TD>
<TD>This program will create an image to visualize ground truth regions and or detected
regions as well as the breast segmentation. The selected items are overlayed on an
existing 8bit PGM image (that could have been created with mkimage). Many options
allow the user to specify the desired lesion type and descriptive properties as well
as the pathology of the lesions that are rendered in the template image. Other options
allow the user to specify the maximum number of detections and the suspiciousness threshold
to use in determining which possible detections (present in the detection file) to plot
on the image. This can be used to visualize the detections and verify the performance of
an algorithm.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>DDSMeval</TD>
<TD>This is a performance evaluation tool that will compute the number of true positive (TP)
detections, the number of false positive (FP) detections and the number of false negative (FN)
detections for an image from the DDSM database given a detection file. Many options
allow the user to specify the desired lesion type and descriptive properties as well
as the pathology of the lesions that are to count as lesions that should be detected. Other options
allow the user to specify the maximum number of detections and the suspiciousness threshold
to use in determining which possible detections (present in the detection file) to declare
as actual detections to use. By default, all BENIGN and MALIGNANT lesions of the lesions
that match the description are used.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>MIAS</TD>
<TD>This is the name of a directory that contains software for pre-processing images and
ground truth from the MIAS database for processing by the AFUM mass detection algorithm.
The directory also contains software for evaluating the performance of the mass detection
algorithm. A script named "evalAFUM_MIAS" in this directory automates the entire pre-processing,
mass detection and performance evaluation process for two subsets of images from the
MIAS database. The images are not provided with the software. They must be aquired by
the user. The output from this process is very similar to the output from running the script
detect_and_FROC_mass on cases from the DDSM database. The purpose of this software is to
allow indpendent verification of the results published in the paper "Mass Detection by
Relative Image Intensity" in the proceeding of the 5th International Workshop on Digital
Mammography. (The proceedings are to be published by Medical Physics Publishers and are
expected to be available in September 2000).
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>combinesusp</TD>
<TD>This program allows the suspicion for masses obtained by the AFUM mass detection program
to be combined in MLO and CC projections to try and improve the performance of the
detection algorithm. The program processes two detection files and creates new detection
files that can be used to obtain a new performance estimate.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>MammoView</TD>
<TD>This is a program written with the X-lib library to display mammograms. It can
display images from the DDSM database by automatically decompressing the images
or can display images in a variety of formats (e.g. generic with user specified rows, cols,
header bytes and bytes per pixel, ".dcm", ".pgm") . It is very general purpose because it
can handle images that are 8 or 16-bits. The program can also overlay the ground truth
for DDSM images, the breast segmentation produced by the program
breastsegment and detections in the format produced by the program detect. The program
is very flexible because of the many command line options that can be specified by the user.
Note that an environment variable must be set for the program to access the jpeg program
to decompress "LJPEG" images. The command setenv JPEG_PROGRAM "/home/captiva1/heath/bin/jpeg"
works on my system because that is where I placed the jpeg program.

Examples of the four mammograms in case1622 displayed with MammoView. The images are displayed
here at a resolution of 1258 microns so they will fit in this small area. The breast boundary
(in orange) and the major axis (in yellow) were found by the breastsegment program. The
detections were generated using the Average Fraction Under the Minimum algorithm and are displayed
with 5mm circles (in red, green, blue and cyan). The ground truth regions
are displayed in red.
