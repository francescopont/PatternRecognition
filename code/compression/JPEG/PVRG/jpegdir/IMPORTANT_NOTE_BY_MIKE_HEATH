To compile the jpeg code on a sun worksation running solaris, I had to do the following...

1) Swap the DEFINES lines in the makefile.

2) Insert the following into "lexer.c" just after the line "#include <stdio.h>".

#ifdef SYSV
#include <sys/fcntl.h>
#endif

I changed cc to gcc.

Under Linux I had trouble with FILE *yyin ={stdin}, *yyout ={stdout}; in lexer.c. The
compiler complained about initializing with something other than a constant. I found
that I could quickly fix this by initializing with NULL and adding lines in each
function in lexer.c to check yyin and yyout to see if they are NULL. If they are then
they need to be set to stdin and stdout respectivly. Those changes are not present
in the code. You may find a better fix for this problem.
