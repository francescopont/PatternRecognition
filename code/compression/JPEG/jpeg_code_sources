o[15] Freely available source code for JPEG

Free, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent
JPEG Group.  Source code, documentation, and test files are included.
Version 6a is available from ftp.uu.net:/graphics/jpeg/jpegsrc.v6a.tar.gz.
If you are on a PC you may prefer ZIP archive format, which you can find at
ftp.simtel.net:/pub/simtelnet/msdos/graphics/jpegsr6a.zip (or at any
Simtel mirror site).  On CompuServe, see the Graphics Support forum
(GO CIS:GRAPHSUP), library 12 "JPEG Tools", file jpegsr6a.zip.

The IJG code includes a reusable JPEG compression/decompression library,
plus sample applications "cjpeg" and "djpeg", which perform conversion
between JPEG JFIF format and image files in PPM/PGM (PBMPLUS), GIF, BMP,
Utah RLE, and Targa formats.  A third application "jpegtran" provides
lossless transcoding between different JPEG formats --- for example, it can
convert a baseline JPEG file to an equivalent progressive JPEG file.  Two
small applications "wrjpgcom" and "rdjpgcom" insert and extract textual
comments in JFIF files.  The package is highly portable; it has been used
successfully on many machines ranging from Apple IIs to Crays.

The IJG code is free for both noncommercial and commercial use; only an
acknowledgement in your documentation is required to use it in a product.
(See the README file in the distribution for details.)

The IJG code has recently been translated into Pascal --- see
ftp.simtel.net:/pub/simtelnet/msdos/turbopas/pasjpg10.zip.  This version
has been tested under Turbo Pascal and Delphi, and it should be portable
to compatible Pascal compilers.


A different free JPEG implementation, written by the PVRG group at Stanford,
is available from havefun.stanford.edu:/pub/jpeg/JPEGv1.2.1.tar.Z.  The PVRG
code is designed for research and experimentation rather than production
use; it is slower, harder to use, and less portable than the IJG code, but
the PVRG code is easier to understand.  Also, the PVRG code supports (the
original form of) lossless JPEG, while the IJG code does not.  But PVRG does
not support progressive JPEG.

There's also a lossless-JPEG-only implementation available from Cornell,
ftp.cs.cornell.edu:/pub/multimed/ljpg.tar.Z.

Neither the PVRG nor Cornell codecs are being actively maintained, but the
IJG code is.

[13] Isn't there a lossless JPEG?

There's a great deal of confusion on this subject, which is not surprising
because there are several different compression methods all known as "JPEG".
The commonly used method is "baseline JPEG" (or its variant "progressive
JPEG").  The same ISO standard also defines a very different method called
"lossless JPEG".  And if that's not confusing enough, a new lossless
standard called "JPEG-LS" is about to hit the streets.

When I say "lossless", I mean mathematically lossless: a lossless
compression algorithm is one that guarantees its decompressed output is
bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  This is much stronger than
"visually indistinguishable from the original".  Baseline JPEG can reach
visual indistinguishability for most photo-like images, but it can never
be truly lossless.

Lossless JPEG is a completely different method that really is lossless.
However, it doesn't compress nearly as well as baseline JPEG; it typically
can compress full-color data by around 2:1.  And lossless JPEG works well
only on continuous-tone images.  It does not provide useful compression of
palette-color images or low-bit-depth images.

Lossless JPEG has never been popular --- in fact, no common applications
support it --- and it is now largely obsolete.  (For example, the new PNG
standard outcompresses lossless JPEG on most images.)  Recognizing this,
the ISO JPEG committee recently finished an all-new lossless compression
standard called JPEG-LS (you may have also heard of it under the name LOCO).
JPEG-LS gives better compression than original lossless JPEG, but still
nowhere near what you can get with a lossy method.  It's anybody's guess
whether this new standard will achieve any popularity.

It's worth repeating that cranking a regular JPEG implementation up to its
maximum quality setting *does not* get you lossless storage; even at the
highest possible quality setting, baseline JPEG is lossy because it is
subject to roundoff errors in various calculations.  Roundoff errors alone
are nearly always too small to be seen, but they will accumulate if you put
the image through multiple cycles of compression (see section 10).

Many implementations won't even let you get to the maximum possible setting,
because it's such an inefficient way to use regular JPEG.  With the IJG JPEG
software, for example, you have to not only select "quality 100" but also
turn off chroma downsampling to minimize loss of information.  The resulting
files are far larger and of only fractionally better quality than files
generated at more reasonable settings.  And they're still slightly lossy!
If you really need lossless storage, don't try to approximate it with
regular JPEG.

LOCO-I/JPEG-LS Software Download Page

                               Hewlett-Packard Laboratories



This page allows you to download a software implementation of JPEG-LS, the emerging
lossless/near-lossless compression standard for continuous-tone images being developed by ISO/IEC
JTC1/SC29/WG1 (draft document FCD14495 as of July 1997). The names of the executables in the
software package derive from the acronym LOCO, as the core of the new standard is based on the
LOCO-I algorithm (LOw COmplexity LOssless COmpression for Images) developed at Hewlett-Packard
Laboratories (reference: M. Weinberger, G. Seroussi, G. Sapiro, "LOCO-I: A Low Complexity,
Context-Based, Lossless Image Compression Algorithm," Proc. IEEE Data Compression Conference,
Snowbird, Utah, March-April 1996). 

The term "near-lossless compression" refers to a lossy algorithm for which each decompressed image
sample differs from the corresponding original image sample by not more than a pre-specified value, the
(usually small) "loss." Lossless compression corresponds to loss=0. Even though the term "continuous-tone
image" refers in principle to any image whose components have more than one bit per sample, palletized
images may require a reordering of the color palette for best compression results using LOCO-I on the
array of color indices. This functionality is not implemented in the present software, although it is supported
by the new standard, and is easy enough to implement with the tools given. Notice, however, that LOCO-I
and JPEG-LS were not designed, and might not give optimal performance, for images that have been
palletized through dithering. 

At various points in the README file, we refer to the CD14495 draft standard. An electronic version of the
draft is available from the official JPEG Web site (a very nice site worth browsing in any case). 

Comparisons with other lossless image compression schemes. Comparisons with the old lossless JPEG
(Huffman and arithmetic), CALIC, and FELICS can be found in the DCC paper. Here is a comparison with
PNG. Notice that there might be slight differences between the compression results reported in the papers
(especially the DCC one), and results obtained with today's JPEG-LS software. These differences are due
to modifications undergone by the algorithm during the standardization process.
